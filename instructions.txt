# Cursor Rules for AI Agent Project

## Tech Stack
- Use React 19 + TypeScript (with Vite) as the base framework.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.
- Use Redux Toolkit for state management.
- Use React Router DOM for routing.
- Use Framer Motion for animations.
- Use React Icons for iconography.

## Folder Structure
- Follow the structure:
  - src/components/ui/ for reusable UI components
  - src/components/LandingPage.tsx for the landing screen
  - src/components/ChatWindow.tsx for the main agent interface
  - src/components/Conversation.tsx for chat message display
  - src/config/templates/ for template configurations
  - src/store/appSlice.ts and conversationSlice.ts for Redux slices
  - src/types/Template.ts and Message.ts for type definitions
  - src/assets/videos/, images/, logos/ for assets

## Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for all code.
- Keep code modular, clean, and extensible.
- Use mock data only (no real chat/voice logic).
- Emphasize animation polish and responsiveness.
- Separate style and content via template config files.
- Ensure all components are mobile-first and responsive.
- Avoid console warnings and TypeScript errors.

## Success Criteria
- App compiles with no TypeScript errors.
- Landing page and chat page are functional.
- Animations are smooth (Framer Motion).
- Mobile responsiveness is verified.
- Voice UI states (mock) are working.
- Video transitions and routing function correctly.
- No console warnings or crashes.

## Developer Notes
- Focus on user journey: video → chat → interaction flow.
- Use mock data for all agent/chat/voice features.
- Reference https://agent.amplitech.ai/97aa9640-6164-468b-8a21-116a9e82202c for sample assets and UI inspiration.
- README.md must include clear setup instructions (Vite, install, run).
- Push the full project to GitHub and provide a screen recording walkthrough upon completion.

# Additional Cursor Rules: Reference UI Flow and Details

## UI Flow (Match Reference Exactly)
- The app must follow this stepwise flow:
  1. **Landing Page:**
     - Dual video background (autoplay, smooth transitions)
     - Company logo at the top
     - Main heading and subheading centered
     - Primary CTA button: "Start Building – Talk to me"
     - Footer with copyright
  2. **Pre-Chat Screen:**
     - Logo remains at the top
     - Centered button: "Let's chat"
     - Footer remains
  3. **Chat Interface:**
     - Logo at the top
     - Prominent agent avatar (with glow/animation)
     - Microphone button (shows "Stop recording" when active, animated icon)
     - (Mock) conversation/messages below

## UI/UX Details
- Branding and layout must remain consistent across all screens (logo always visible, centered content)
- All transitions between screens must be smooth and animated (Framer Motion/Tailwind)
- The microphone button must clearly indicate its state (recording, idle, etc.) with animation
- The agent avatar should be visually central and animated in the chat interface
- Use minimal, modern, and clean design as seen in the reference
- All text, button labels, and layout should match the reference exactly
- No extra screens or steps beyond those in the reference

## Implementation Notes
- Always refer to these rules and the reference UI for any design or flow decisions
- Prioritize matching the reference over adding new features or customizations
